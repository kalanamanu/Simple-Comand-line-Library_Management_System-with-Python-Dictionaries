Project 1: Library Management System
1. Define the Library Data Structure:

    Create a data structure (e.g., a dictionary) to represent the library.
    Each book should have a unique ID, title, author, and availability status.

2. Display Available Books:

    Write a function to display a list of available books in the library.
    Iterate through the library data structure and print details for books with positive availability.

3. Implement Borrow and Return Functions:

    Create functions to handle borrowing and returning books.
    For borrowing, check if the book is available and update the availability status.
    For returning, increment the availability status of the book.

4. Implement Add Book Function:

    Write a function to add a new book to the library.
    Prompt the user for book details like ID, title, author, and initial stock.
    Check if the book ID is unique and add the book to the library.

5. User Interface:

    Implement a user interface loop that presents a menu of options to the user.
    Options should include displaying available books, borrowing, returning, adding a new book, and exiting the system.
    Use input statements to get user choices and call the corresponding functions.

6. Testing:

    Test each function and the overall system by simulating various scenarios.
    Ensure that borrowing and returning functions update the library appropriately.
    Verify that adding a new book works correctly.

7. Documentation:

    Add comments and documentation to your code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.
    Include instructions for users on how to interact with the system.

8. Enhancements (Optional):

    Add error handling for invalid inputs.
    Implement a search feature for finding books by title, author, or ID.
    Consider using a file to store the library data for persistence between program runs.

9. Reflection:

    Reflect on the project, what you've learned, and areas for improvement.
    Consider ways to further enhance the system or how you might apply similar concepts to other projects.

This detailed outline should guide you through the process of creating a Library Management System. Feel free to customize and expand upon these steps based on your preferences and learning goals.
